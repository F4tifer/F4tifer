# 👋 Hi, I'm Marek

I'm a technically oriented enthusiast focused on **Python, hardware, automation, and smart home systems**.  
I enjoy connecting **software with the real world** — measurement, control, data, and optimization.

## 🧠 What I enjoy working on

- 🐍 Python (automation, scripts, GUI)
- 🔌 Hardware & electronics (measurement, relays, sensors)
- 🏠 Smart Home (Home Assistant, Zigbee, Matter)
- 🧪 Testing & QA (test plans, validation)
- 📊 Data collection, logging, and visualization
- ⚙️ Building things that don’t normally exist

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, Bash  
- **HW / IoT:** ESP32, sensors, relays, Zigbee  
- **Platforms:** Home Assistant, Linux, macOS

## 🎯 My approach

> “If I build something, I want to understand **why**, **how**, and **what data it produces**.”

- simple and practical solutions  
- readability over magic  
- automate everything possible  
- documentation that still makes sense a year later
